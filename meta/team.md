Friedrich is the technical lead for OpenSpending and [Spending Stories](http://blog.okfn.org/2011/06/22/spending-stories-is-a-winner-of-the-knight-news-challenge/). He lives in Berlin and is a media scientist turned coder working on open government and transparency initiatives. After presenting the German state budget on [OffenerHaushalt.de](http://bund.offenerhaushalt.de/) in 2010, he is now working on technologies that allow the budgets and spending records of any state and region to explored. He also helped create data portals for a number of European administrations and is working on an effort to create a pan-European data catalogue at [publicdata.eu](http://publicdata.eu/). He is the author of [Adhocracy](https://adhocracy.de/), a collaborative drafting software used by the Internet commission of the German Bundestag and other organizations to enable citizens to contribute and vote on policy documents.

Lucy is the community lead for OpenSpending as well as Data Journalism activities at the Open Knowledge Foundation. She was a co-author of the 'Technology for Transparent and Accountable Public Finance' report for the GIFT initiative and is currently working on a project mapping out the [requirements of Civil Society Organisations](http://blog.openspending.org/2012/01/12/civil-society-and-spending-data-who-is-mapping-the-money/) in relation to spending data. Where the spheres of Data Journalism and spending intersect, she is also involved with the [Spending Stories](http://blog.okfn.org/2011/06/22/spending-stories-is-a-winner-of-the-knight-news-challenge/) project, aiming to help journalists find, use and present spending data to the public.
