<h2>UK Departmental Spending</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>Every entity within the UK central government is held to report its
    expenditure once a month. However, the data released through this
    mechanism is patchy - some national bodies and local councils report
    all of their spending in great detail, while others report nothing or
    export theirdata in forms which are hard to interpret. This leads to
    a skewed picture of government finances - as it becomes hard for data
    users to distinguish between the absence of data and the absence of
    transactions having taken place.</p>

    <p>This is why we decided to initiate a collaboration between OpenSpending
    and the team behind <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> to help
    fix this issue. We've built a data cleansing and validation toolkit which
    makes the data available in regular intervals while it easier to spot
    departments that are not keeping up with their publication requirements.
    </p>

    <p>The tool <a href="report/index.html">lists all public bodies registered as data publishers on
      data.gov.uk</a> and details how well they have followed the 
    <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_transparency_index.htm">HM
      Treasury reporting guidelines</a>. It will also make the whole of the
    reported data available for search and analysis - either within the
    OpenSpending platform or as a bulk download.</p>

    <h3>Clean-up stages</h3>

    <p>The clean-up and integration of the (over 6000) spreadsheet documents required a
    number of stages, ranging from retrieval to validation. Below we provide
    a brief overview of the technical stages involved in the process:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Going through the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/data/search?tags=spend-transactions">index on data.gov.uk</a>, we tried to <strong>retrieve all
        of the linked resources</strong>. Many of them turned out to be missing, either 
      because they had been invalid in the first place, or because the data had
      been removed since their publication.</li>
      <li>Next, the downloaded <strong>files format had to be detected</strong>. While the treasury 
      mandates that files should be released as CSV (comma-separated values), many
      entities publish their spending in Excel or OpenOffice formats. Some 
      departments are also still publishing PDF files, which cannot be analyzed 
      automatically.</li>
      <li>Once the format of the data is understood, we need to <strong>find and match 
        the given column headers</strong> from the data with those field names mandated by
      the Treasury. While the guidance names 16 headers, few departments actually
      report on all of them. On the other hand, many add their own data, such as
      project identifiers or non-standard classification schemes. To ensure data
      quality, many of the colum headers had to be matched manually, using the 
      <a href="http://nomenklatura.okfnlabs.org/">nomenklatura</a> web interface.
      </li>
      <li>Within some of the required fields, we decided to further <strong>apply cleansing
      and integration tools</strong>. This included simple tools to interpret dates and numbers, but also 
      <a href="http://opencorporates.com">OpenCorporates</a> to reconcile supplier 
      names and <a href="http://nomenklatura.okfnlabs.org/">nomenklatura</a> for 
      department family names.</li>
      </li>
      <li>Finally, data had to <strong>pass validation</strong>. Out of a total of 
      7mn extracted transactions, only 4mn met the minimum requirement of having both 
      an amount and date associated with them.</li>
    </ul>

    In all, the process is still very prone to errors and the messiness of the 
    input data is making a strong case for the enforcement (and technical implementation)
    of a <a href="http://spendingdata.org/">standard for transactional spending data</a>.
