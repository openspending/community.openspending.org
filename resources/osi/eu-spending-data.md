# Growing the community working on EU spending data

<div class="well">This segment is based on a <a href="http://openspending.org/blog/2013/01/09/privacy.html">community call organised on 18 February
2013</a> with
additional input from <a href="https://twitter.com/ronpatz">Ronny Patz</a>,
Transparency International, Brussels Office.</div>

Among journalists and CSOs European spending programmes are in these
years undergoing increased scrutiny. In this section we will examine the
access to data from the EU Structural Funds as well as the EU Commission
spending through the Financial Transparency System (FTS) and discuss
what actors are are involved in data driven analysis and campaigning
around this.

## Structural Funds

Following the Common Agricultural Policy, which has been covered by
Farmsubsidy.org (see other section), data from the structural funds have
been considered as the most important spending data by journalists as
well as CSOs. In 2010 the Financial Times and the Bureau of
Investigative Journalism published a project including an extensive
database [mapping the structural
funds](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/case_studies_1.html) across
for the 2007-2013 EU budget. The project was rightly heralded as
groundbreaking for its level of detail, dedication and cross border
setup. Three years later it is however also clear that such centralised
initiated projects have clear limitations, and therefore challenges
remain when thinking about how European wide spending transparency.

### Data issues

The FT-TBIJ structural funds-investigation exposed a series of barriers,
which limits the use of structural funds for CSOs and journalists:

1.  Poor data quality

1.  Lack of access to data in machine readable formats. In practise data
    is often published as PDF as no format for the spending data has
    been specified in EU regulation

2.  A dispersed model of distribution across regions in Europe from
    dusins of local sites without a European centralised clearing house

### Community challenges

We’ve identified a few important points, which should be noted from the
project:

1.  Media outlets are unlikely to build and sustain long term data
    projects: Though the project provided a unique insight into
    structural funds, it was not the intention from the publishers to
    develop a long term model for tracing and publishing  structural
    fund payments. Though non-profit media institutions do offer a [few
    important exceptions](http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/),
    we also know that maintaining databases is costly and is vastly
    considered providing too little value for ongoing beat journalism inside
    newsrooms.
2.  CSOs have not addressed systemic needs for data: Despite receiving
    wide recognition from CSOs regarding the importance of the FT-TBIJ
    structural funds-investigation, the European CSO-community has
    remained unable to address the need for continuous data flows and
    analytical capacity. Several CSOs do however provide extensive
    coverage of European data across topics like FOI (AccessInfo),
    lobbyism (Corporate Europe, Alter-EU) and the green economy
    (Bankwatch, Friends of the Earth).
3.  Improvements in access to data seems still to be largely supply
    driven: There are national governmental initiatives addressing the
    lack of access to spending data such as [Open
    Coesione](http://www.opencoesione.gov.it/) from the Italian
    government (launched summer 2012), which publishes data on Italian
    structural funds from 450,000 development projects worth € 33.4
    billion. Project Lead [Luigi Reggi](http://luigireggi.eu) is
    regularly engaging with data journalists and the wider public
    through open data events and social media.

[Luigi Reggi](http://luigireggi.eu) has also mapped the accessibility of
EU structural funds data across the EU:

## Future perspectives

The data from the EU Structural Funds is an example where CSOs and media
outlets are still falling short from the potential of covering already
available spending data in individual countries as well as across
borders.

At this moment there seems to be no clear political momentum within the
EU for requiring data from the Structural Funds to be published at a
central site (eg. on the European Data Portal).

New rules will however mandate publishing of structural fund data
according to certain dimensions or fields, which provide a small step in
the right direction ([page
157](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0496:FIN:EN:PDF))

## The Financial Transparency System (FTS)

Spending reported under the FTS consist of both [EU Commission spending
and grant funding](http://openspending.org/resources/eu/) provided to
programmes such as research, education and foreign aid, is likely the best documented part of the EU budget, though it is not transactional spending data, as it only provide project funding data,
and thus not actual transactions from either EU agencies not project recipients.

An increase in the minimum threshold is however under consideration,
which could cause a decrease in access to a substantial amount of
payments.
