In Slovenia, the anti-corruption agency has published the financial transparency site [Supervizor](http://supervizor.kpk-rs.si/) since 2011. 

The Supervizor application:
- contains by now 50 mio. transactions from both government and local agencies to government contractors from 2003 to 2013
- matched such transactions to company records including director lists and corporate leadership 
- applies the actual bank transactions from public bank accounts at the Slovenian National Bank as source making the records highly reliable.

According to the developer behind the platform, the granularity of the data has enabled statisticians and anaylysts to make statistical models available, with one example mentioned being Hidden Markov en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model. 

Over the years the platform has helped identify shifts in in contractor purchases around changes in the political leadership.  

#Lack of impact?
The database has however despite its comprehensive content and site visualisations not received any significant response from journalists nor CSOs. While it is not reasonable to speculate based on the available interview, we find it worth considering how one of the most transparent spending platforms should suffer from limited use.
