The voices and stories from organisations in this report underline the diversity of the  community working at the intersection of technology and government finances. Here we’ll list some of the key points from the research, which has allowed us to acquire a deeper understanding of the work that’s being done to advance financial transparency.

## Demand for data

It is impossible to deny that there is demand for open financial data.

This report has clearly outlined that there is demand for openly available, open [as per the Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/) (see next point). This is in particular data about:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Budgets</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Spending</strong> - crucially, at <strong> transaction level</strong></li>
	<li> <strong>Procurement</strong> - includes information on contractual agreements between suppliers and government entities:</li>
		<ul>
			<li> <strong> Contracts </strong> - understood as the documents containing the contractual agreements between public agencies and private companies. These can be important sources for CSOs and journalists when examining the terms of service, fee structures and names of the signatories. Many governments however argue that contracts are commercially confidential as reasoning for only disclosing redacted contracts or not disclosing contract at all. Read more at <a href="http://www.open-contracting.org/">Open Contracting</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Company Information</strong> - in order to be able to answer questions related to policy and outsourcing decisions, integrity and effectiveness of the contracting process and the track records of companies contracting with governments to name but a few. Further reading - the <a href="http://opencorporates.com/downloads/ogp_company_data_report.pdf">OpenCorporates report</a> on open corporate data in Open Government Partnership Countries.
			<li><strong>Information on people in positions of power, business and family associations </strong> - <em>not</em> information about individual citizens. This is to help understand key questions, “who is responsible for a given political decision?”, “what relationships (family, friend etc) are there between winners of tenders and people within government? (are there any conflicts of interest?)”. (* See note) </li>
			</ul>
</ul>

International (e.g. Farm Subsidies), National - and Local level data is demanded.

<small>* So far, there have been a few well-coordinated attempts to standardise and collect this biographical information, [Popit from MySociety](http://popit.mysociety.org/) and [Popolo from OpenNorth and the Participatory Politics Foundation](http://blog.opennorth.ca/2013/02/21/update-on-opengovernment/), however - a coordinated international effort is required in order to maintain this enormous, and rapidly evolving dataset. </small>


###  Proactive spending release doesn’t necessarily make strong civil societies

In some countries there is high quality spending data and no journalists or CSOs making much use of the data.

For example Slovenia has since 2011 arguably had one of the leading models for publishing government transactions. Yet there seems to have been little uptake among journalists or CSOs. While one reason might clearly be that making sense of large spending datasets requires substantial skills, what the case of Slovenia maybe demonstrates more than anything is that governmental access to data might actually offer little guidance as to how vibrant the civil society on spending transparency actually is. This is perhaps simply a matter of training, or perhaps a language barrier for countries where training materials are available.

Likewise, we struggled to find many civil society organisations in Greece, who were not technical users, making use of the data released as part of the Cl@rity programme.

## Data Supply

### There are clear leaders amongst governments regarding publishing practices

During our research, we regularly heard phrases such as “I want procurement data like Slovakia” or “How did you convince the UK government to release transaction-level spending?”. While we acknowledge that there is still work to be done on both accounts, such examples should be seen as the forefront of open data policies, and used as examples to help civil society initiatives demand more from their own countries.

Civil Society organisations could be equipped with these examples, for example, when entering consultations with governments as part of Civil Society Action plans for Open Government Partnership meetings. A lot of effort is currently being dedicated to talking about standards for open government data, and this early benchmarking would enable countries to act independently (and hence more quickly than a full, international standardisation effort) to open up their data in a usable format. A possible next step is to prepare a toolkit of best practice examples for Civil Society organisations to use in benchmarking and consultations with governments.

This would hopefully lead to more concrete, and actionable country action plans for the Open Government Partnership, based on real, practical examples.

### Public pressure is only one of many reasons to the release of better spending data

Recent improvements to spending transparency in Greece and Slovenia appear to be driven by factors not related to public pressure for transparency. In Greece the financial crisis has created a significant boost to centralised fiscal management endorsed. It is somewhat striking that Greece has gone from one of the least financially transparent in Europe enforcing transparency, by mandating that decisions must be published on the internet, in order to be legally enforcable.

In Slovenia the [Supervizor site](https://www.kpk-rs.si/en/project-transparency/supervizor-73) seems to have been driven by a combination of a strong independent anti-corruption commission and access to pro-bono development resources to prototype and develop the models.

## Supply-side obstacles preventing re-use of data

### Lack of bulk downloadable, machine-readable data is an obstacle to transparency and accountability

Many governments believe that publishing financial data online in HTML or PDF equals making the data “open”. For this reason, many CSOs struggle with the task of scraping content off website—if they even know it is possible to do so. In the the worst cases, automatic access or scrapers may be impeded by CAPTCHA codes. Bulk download of machine-readable data is crucial to allow organisations to keep a copy in case information disappears from the internet.

Many organisations have identified PDF releases as a substantial barrier to re-use. Though organisations often manage to complete projects, the governmental policies to release PDFs impedes workflow and increase demand for members with technical skills.

(Further reading: [Appendix: Putting the Open Data into Open Budgets](../appendix/open-budgets-open-data/); [Appendix: Common arguments against publishing data in machine-readable formats (and how to counter them)](../appendix/machinereadfaq/).

### Privacy Concerns

Often cited as one of the reasons for not releasing this level of detail in detail, but often needlessly so. Technology and good data-management practices make it possible to develop a workflow, which allows sensitive information to be removed within a government body, prior to publication. A little training may be required within government, but the process is relatively straightforward once a suppression list is built. With Ian Makgill, OpenSpending has developed a thorough guide, which addresses main risks when releasing spending data from local councils. This guide can be found in the appendix.

(Further reading: [How to publish spending data without disclosing personal information](../appendix/privacyguide/))

### Arbitrary release thresholds

At least two of the countries which release transaction-level data have imposed seemingly arbitrary thresholds on the size of transactions that are included in releases. For example, the US and the UK exclude transactions under $25,000 and 25,000 GBP, respectively.

Are these thresholds appropriate? That can't be known for sure without more information about how these numbers were arrived at. Principally, having thresholds or exceptions to the reporting of this data depends on the underlying systems that drive disclosure of this data. There must either be a publicly stated and rational reason for these disclosure thresholds - or they should be lowered (or ideally, removed entirely).

# Looking ahead

## Don’t reinvent the wheel

Many of the budget and spending projects which we feature in this report have developed tailored applications fitting their particular conditions. From the comprehensive budget site of Hasadna to the database of [K-Monitor in Hungary](http://www.k-monitor.hu/search) platforms have been developed to adapt to the data available and the focus of the individual project.

It is a wise approach to develop a tool for one country initially (it helps prevent 'meta solutions' that half-solve everyone's issues rather than genuinely solving a genuine problem). However, once a solution has been proven to work, using it as a template to roll out with customisation in other countries may be very wise. We hope the case studies featured here and in the videos are of use, and we would be happy to facilitate connections to those behind the projects. (Simply email info [at] openspending.org).

## More community mapping projects!

Mapping research such as this is incredibly important to help find gaps and make connections. We have highlighted in this report a couple of other areas which could perhaps benefit from a similar research project.

## Teach people

Based on the interviews, we’ve found that several skills repeatedly turn out to be lacking. While the pool of skills is hugely diverse across the community, key parts of the data pipeline from data retrieval to data cleaning are major hurdles, which steal time from activism and other parts of an organisation's work.

We could therefore see a strong potential in offering focused trainings around the key needs identified:
<ul>
	<li><strong>webscraping</strong>: when budget and procurement data needs to be peeled of the web scraping in the only option. We see no reason for to wait for governments to publish the data in bulk, so trainings in tools like ScraperWiki could help expand skills and increase data retrieval</li>
	<li><strong>liberating and cleaning PDFs quickly</strong>: with new tools available there’s a real potential for upgrading the skills of communities. Both when it comes to web scraping and PDF liberation scaling models should be explored. As the needs for these tools are common and accessible a set up of training of trainers should be explored, in order to build the local pools of skills.</li>
	<li><strong>build FOI request skills</strong>: Help groups acquire the FOI skills needed for advancing access to spending data, as many countries still apply archaic principles of FOI.</li>
	<li><strong>see the <a href="../appendix/tool-ecosystem/">tools ecosystem</a></strong> for more details on particular problems regularly faced by organisations, and how to tackle them.</li>
</ul>

## Develop strategies for obtaining quick wins on transactional spending transparency
The past three years UK, Brazil, US, Slovenia and Greece has released transactional spending data. Despite those successes it is relevant to ask why release policies on transactional spending data have not spread faster e.g. to neighbouring countries.

The spending community should be equipped to push for spending data by mapping access, regulation and publication flows across countries.

## Language - boost translations

The demand for training materials and knowledge sharing outside the anglophone language community should be addressed. In practise this can be done by providing trainings in first languages across countries where spending transparency is advanced.

Multi-language knowledge sharing should also include boosting translations of key resource materials such as the Spending Data Handbook into multiple languages. As practical factsheets are being drafted on topics such as spending standards, FOI-models, privacy and data analysis these should be translated as well. Distribution across CSO networks should also be increased in order to reach the organisations who might work on spending transparency.

# On the methodology and terminology

## Common vocabulary and language barriers

Two of the most common words which frame the transparency debate, *open* and *standard*, are used differently in policy and technical spheres -two key proponents of the transparency movement. This often leads to conversations happening at cross-purposes and hinders communication across the community.

<table border="1">	
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Term</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Open Data / Technical Community Usage</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Policy Sphere Usage</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Open</td>
		<td>Free to use, reuse and redistribute - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike. (See <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">The Open Definition</a>).</td>
		<td>Publicy available and accessible.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Standard</td>
		<td>A technical specification for code or data. For example, <a href="http://community.openspending.org/research/standard/">the draft spending standard</a> by the Spending Data Community.</td>
		<td>Best practice guidelines for a particular behaviour, or benchmarks.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

As a result, special care and attention should be used when using these terms, particularly in formulating requests of governments.

## Language diversity and inclusiveness

We recognise in this report that we have largely covered examples from projects who are able to communicate fluently in English. We also recognise that often, having projects featured in reports such as this, which are read by funders, policy-makers and researchers can give projects a much-needed PR boost.

Likewise, language presents problems for the people working on the data. In countries like India - with multiple national languages, there need to be coalitions of like-minded people who are both linguists and data wranglers if real analysis covering entire countries is to be achieved.

In a similar vein, while terms like "data journalism" are currently dominating English Language discourse, it is unclear to what extent they have spread into other languages. Translation efforts and careful construction of networks will be key to ensuring that this debate does not become too anglocentric.
