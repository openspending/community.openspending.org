# Executive Summary 

## Status Quo 

### Demand for data 

It is clear and undeniable that there is an unquenched demand for financial data about governments from Civil Society. In particular, for data on:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Budgets</strong></li>
	<li>Spending - crucially, at <strong> transaction level</strong></li>  
	<li> Procurement</li>
</ul>

This should be:
* *[machine readable](machinereadfaq.html)*.
* Available at international (e.g. EU farm subsisides), national and local levels.
