# Highlights

## Status Quo 

### Demand for data 

From our interviews and discussions with civil society organisations for this study, we found that there is strong demand for more higher quality, machine readable data about public revenues and expenditures. In particular, for data on:

<ul>
	<li>Budgets</li>
	<li>Spending - crucially, at transaction level</li>  
	<li>Procurement</li>
	<li>Revenues</li>
	<li><a href="../appendix/other-handy-datasets/">Other Useful Datasets</a></li>
</ul>

This should be:

* proactively released 
* [machine readable](../appendix/machinereadfaq/)
* available at international (e.g. EU farm subsisidies), national and local levels
* published as open data to enable reuse

It should also be stated that no amount of proactive release can replace the need for Freedom of Information requests, which remain of prime importance. 

[Read the full guidelines](../appendix/open-budgets-open-data/)/

### Key Obstacles in Preventing Re-use of the Data

The following should be avoided at all costs when publishing government financial data.

* Absence of bulk download option
* CAPTCHA codes preventing automated download
* Publishing data in HTML or PDFs

### Common vocabulary and language barriers

Two of the most common words which frame the transparency debate, *open* and *standard*, are used differently in policy and technical spheres -two key proponents of the transparency movement. This often leads to conversations happening at cross-purposes and hinders communication across the community.

<table border="1">	
	<tr>
		<td><strong>Term</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Open Data / Technical Community Usage</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Policy Sphere Usage</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Open</td>
		<td>Free to use, reuse and redistribute - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike. (See <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">The Open Definition</a>).</td>
		<td>Publicy available and accessible.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Standard</td>
		<td>A technical specification for code or data. For example, <a href="http://community.openspending.org/resources/standard/">the draft spending standard</a> by the Spending Data Community.</td>
		<td>Best practice guidelines for a particular behaviour, or benchmarks.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

As a result, special care and attention should be used when using these terms, particularly in formulating requests of governments.

### When it comes to publishing standards- there are clear role-models to follow

We regularly heard phrases such as “I want procurement data like Slovakia” or “How did you convince the UK government to release transaction-level spending?”. While we acknowledge that there is still work to be done on both accounts, such examples should be seen as the forefront of open data policies, and used as examples to help civil society initiatives demand more from their own countries.

### Offering civil-society-led, free technical help to governments may promote transparency

For example, in Slovenia the [Supervizor site](https://www.kpk-rs.si/en/project-transparency/supervizor-73) seems to have been driven by a combination of a strong independent anti-corruption commission and access to pro-bono development resources to prototype and develop the models.

### The training needs

Based on the interviews we’ve found that several skills are repeatedly emerging. While the pool of skills is hugely diversity across the community, key parts of the data pipeline from data retrieval to data cleaning are major hurdles, which steal time from activism and other parts of an organisation's work.

A key aim during our work was to work out an [ecosystem of tools](../appendix/tool-ecosystem/) which could be used as a basis for working out where effort should be focussed for future training efforts. All of the skills there could be useful for training, but there are a couple that are particularly prominent, due to the frequency of the problem. </li>)

We could therefore see a strong potential in offering focused trainings around the key needs identified:
<ul>
	<li><strong>webscraping</strong>: when budget and procurement data needs to be peeled of the web scraping in the only option. We see no reason for to wait for governments to publish the data in bulk, so trainings in tools like ScraperWiki could help expand skills and increase data retrieval</li>
	<li><strong>liberating and cleaning PDFs quickly</strong>: with new tools available there’s a real potential for upgrading the skills of communities. Both when it comes to web scraping and PDF liberation scaling models should be explored. As the needs for these tools are common and accessible a set up of training of trainers should be explored, in order to build the local pools of skills.</li>
	<li><strong>build FOI request skills</strong>: Help groups acquire the FOI skills needed for advancing access to spending data, as many countries still apply archaic principles of FOI.</li>
</ul>
