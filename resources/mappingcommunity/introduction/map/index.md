<p>As an additional appendix to this report, we have published links to all of the organisations who we encountered of spoke to during our research and created a [map of their projects](http://apps.openspending.org/oscontactsmap/). The majority have some kind of online presence and use technology either to get, clean, analyse, or present their data.</p>
