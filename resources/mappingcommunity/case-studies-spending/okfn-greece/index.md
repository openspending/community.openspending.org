<div class="well">Project: Tracing financial reporting from the Cl@rity program.</div>
<p>*This project review is based on the detailed review of Thodoris<br />
Papadopoulos, Open Knowledge Foundation Greece, Local Group.*</p>
<p>Open Knowledge Foundation Greece is monitoring the financial reporting systems in<br />
Greece during the financial crisis, resulting in detailed reviews of<br />
the rapid legal and technical changes in the Greek financial<br />
reporting system. This has ultimately lead to several proposals for technical changes to the reporting standards.</p>

<p>## About the project</p>
<p>In Greece, the most important piece of legislation in recent years<br />
regarding the transparency of government action is the [Cl@rity](http://diavgeia.gov.gr/) (Diavgeia)<br />
program, which introduced the obligation to publish all the decisions of<br />
government and all administrative entities on the Internet.<br />
Cl@rity aims to generate maximum<br />
accessibility of government policy and administrative actions. Since the<br />
programme was launched in October 2010, almost 6 million administrative<br />
decisions have been uploaded to the Cl@rity website, with a daily<br />
average of 14,000 decisions.</p>
<p>With the Cl@rity program, the enforceability of any administrative act<br />
presupposes a previous announcement on the Internet. Furthermore,<br />
Cl@rity provides an open data API in XML and JSON formats through which<br />
everyone can have structured access to all decisions, along with their<br />
metadata, ensuring openness and further dissemination of public<br />
information.</p>
<p>The Cl@rity initiative has already had a quiet but significant<br />
effect on the way authorities handle their executive power. It leaves<br />
considerably less room for corruption and exposes it much more easily<br />
when it takes place, since any citizen or interested party can openly<br />
access any questionable acts. This is a scheme of “collective scrutiny”<br />
that can be effective, since it allows citizens directly involved or<br />
concerned with an issue to scrutinize it in depth rather than leaving<br />
it to the traditional media, whose choice of issues often is restricted<br />
and oriented towards “safe” topics.</p>
<p>## Challenges</p>
<p>Although Cl@rity was not designed with financial monitoring in mind, it<br />
includes various decision types that includes financial metadata<br />
(such as expenditure, budget, and contract data). From the onset, however,<br />
the Cl@rity programme has suffered from issues of poor data quality, including:</p>
<p>*  Failure to provide a hierarchy of entities<br />
*  Lack of validation rules for metadata fields and non-mandatory<br />
    requirements</p>
<p>In reality, these issues have prevented citizens and journalists from<br />
utilizing the full potential of the Cl@rity program as a platform for<br />
public financial data.</p>
<p>## Project results</p>
<p>Open Knowledge Foundation Greece highlights two major achievements from their data quality review and proposals:</p>
<p>1.  For the Cl@rity programme, substantial improvements have been<br />
    implemented by the end of 2012. These corrections included changes<br />
    of significant importance to journalists and CSOs, such as improving<br />
    the quality of transactional spending data.<br />
2.  For a supplementary information system to support the Cl@rity<br />
    program, several suggestions brought forward by Open Knowledge Foundation Greece have been<br />
    admitted to the data architecture. The new system will for this<br />
    reason be more responsive and accurate and will provide a more detailed<br />
    data model with many more metadata fields. The new system is<br />
    expected to be delivered by the end of 2013. The owner of the system<br />
    the [Greek Ministry of Administrative Reform and<br />
    e-Governance](http://www.ydmed.gov.gr/) has undertaken to provide<br />
    the source code of the system through the [European Open Source<br />
    Observatory and<br />
    Repository](http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/description) under<br />
    a [EUPL](http://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl) licence.</p>
