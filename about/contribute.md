## Contribute to the platform

If you want to work with data already on OpenSpending you can dive right in and go to [the tutorials](http://openspending.org/help/index.html). 
Or go right ahead and start working on one of the datasets already available on the OpenSpending [platform](http://openspending.org/datasets). 

We also welcome help with translation of the platform into other langauges. See the list of current translation projects [here](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openspending/). 

Help us map cities already on OpenSpending by adding the information [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqR8dXc6Ji4JdHZZNUpWQ2paY3FfYTdFNXkxZXZDTWc#gid=0).

Do you have story about how used spending data for an investigation or how you're working on get hold of government spending, we'd love suggestions for guest blog posts! 

Or simply get in touch. You can [register your details with us](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dENlX1RvOGFNeURBSDRkc2pVMjZvR0E6MA#gid=0) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible to help you get started. 

### Help us uploading fresh data to OpenSpending
We are constantly taking on more data sets. Have a look to see if you help [clean and upload one of the datasets](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvdkMlz2NopEdElqWTBJS0Q1Q083VlI3YUFLTl9OY0E#gid=0) we're currently planning to add to OpenSpending. 

Get in touch about how you can help uploading fresh data via our [mailing list](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending). 

### Are you a developer?
Of course, OpenSpending is an [open source](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) 
project and we aim to include contributions into production as quickly 
as possible. 

We work as a distributed team and most discussions take place either on the
[openspending-dev](http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending-dev)
mailing list or on IRC (``#openspending`` on FreeNode).

If you feel like hacking core, check out the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/openspending) to see what is going on and where help is needed.
