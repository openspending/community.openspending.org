If you are a member of the OpenSpending community---whether you
contribute datasets, work on building or testing code, or develop
stories and visualizations using OpenSpending data---this site belongs
to you.

[The OpenSpending Community Site](/) is a place to showcase the
OpenSpending community's work and to share its resources. It includes:

* a [blog][1] to share new work by community members
* information about community [events][3b]
* a set of [help][4] documents on the OpenSpending system
* a collection of [research][2] using OpenSpending data and [resources][2] on spending data research
* guidance on [how to get involved][3] with the community

Our [blog](http://blog.openspending.org) is powered by WordPress.  The
Community Site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which makes it
easy for community members to contribute via pull requests on our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/openspending/community.openspending.org).


To get involved see the [Get Involved page][3].
