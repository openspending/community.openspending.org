OpenSpending exists to *map the money worldwide* &ndash; that is, to
track and analyse public financial information globally.  It is meant
to be a resource for individuals and groups who wish to
discuss and investigate public financial information, including
journalists, academics, campaigners, and more. Concretely,
OpenSpending is:

* A central, high-quality, open **platform** for public financial information, including budgets, spending, balance sheets, procurement etc
* A **community** of users and contributors to this database
* A set of **open resources** providing technical, fiscal, and political understanding necessary to work with financial information.

We are currently building [the next version of OpenSpending](/next/).  Find out more about how to [get involved](/get-involved/).

## Project History

The original version of [OpenSpending](http://openspending.org)
represents more than 6 years of development with at least 2 major
iterations of the platform.  Originally launched as
[Where Does My Money Go](http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org/) in 2009,
OpenSpending joined forces with other projects in 2011 and expanded to become
OpenSpending.

Today, the original OpenSpending database has over 1000 datasets
representing roughly 28k transactions.  In addition, there are more
than 30 local “Where Does My Money Go” sites powered by OpenSpending
from Brazil to Nicaragua, Cameroon to Bosnia.

## Project Principles

OpenSpending is guided by its community principles.

* **Open materials**. All material created within the project will be [open data and open content](http://opendefinition.org) built with [open tools](http://opensource.org). All project data is made available under the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) or another [Open Data Commons license](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/).
* **Open community**. Anyone interested in financial data can contribute. We're friendly to newcomers and old hands alike—everyone was new once, and we value all levels of experience.
* **Doing**. Our focus is on the concrete, not the abstract, and on making rather than theorizing.

## Governance

### Principles

* The OpenSpending project is **community-owned and community-run**. Both individuals and organizations - non-profit and for-profit - may participate.
* The project's **Steering Group** has overall responsibility for the project. This includes engaging with community members and communicating decisions.
* [Open Knowledge][ok] is the project's **legal and institutional home**. This stewardship responsibiliy confers no direct control over or special role in managing the project. At the same time, Open Knowledge may have other roles in the project, for example, as a member of the Steering Group. The project is also accountable to Open Knowledge regarding conformance with Open Knowledge project guidelines and principles of openness.
