[OpenSpending](http://openspending.org) exists to "**map the money
worldwide**" &ndash; that is, to track and analyse public financial
information globally. Concretely, OpenSpending is:

* A central, high-quality, open **database** of public financial information, including budgets, spending, balance sheets, procurement etc
* A **community** of users and contributors to this database
* A set of **open resources** providing technical, fiscal, and political understanding necessary to work with financial information.

[The OpenSpending database](http://openspending.org) is a resource for
the many individuals and groups who wish to discuss and investigate
public financial information, including journalists, academics,
campaigners, and more.

# Project Principles

OpenSpending is guided by its community principles.

* **Open materials**. All material created within the project will be [open data and open content](http://opendefinition.org) built with [open tools](http://opensource.org). All project data is made available under the [Open Database License](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) or another [Open Data Commons license](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/).
* **Open community**. Anyone interested in financial data can contribute. We're friendly to newcomers and old hands alike—everyone was new once, and we value all levels of experience.
* **Doing**. Our focus is on the concrete, not the abstract, and on making rather than theorizing.
