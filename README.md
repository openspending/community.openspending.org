OpenSpending Community Site
===========================

This repo contains:

  * New Jekyll site for the OpenSpending Community
  * Help and documentation for the platform
  * Community resources: similar projects, best practices, briefings
  * Meta-Info: Contact, credits, funders, etc.

From the root directory of the site, run ``bundle install`` to
download the site requirements.  Then run ``bundle exec jekyll serve``
to see the site hosted locally at http://0.0.0.0:4000/.

Pull requests welcome ;)
