More than half of us [live in a city](http://www.unfpa.org/pds/urbanization.htm). From schools to fire brigades cities are responsible for some of the most important services we can think of when it comes to government. So whether the nearby school is paid by your city, council or [Município](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Brazil) chances are that the service is operated near you and that everyone should have access to information about the money is being spent. 
We're therefore thrilled to announce that the OpenSpending community is organising a global **City Spending Party - July 19th to 21st**.<br>

The Spending Party is a result of the planning from a wide area of groups including [Hasadna](http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/) (israel), [OpenBudgetOakland](http://openbudgetoakland.org/), [OpenKratio](openkratio.org/), [BudgIT](http://yourbudgit.com/) (Nigeria) [OKF Japan](http://spending.jp/) and [OKF Nepal](https://twitter.com/okfn_np). With the City Spending Data Party we want to open budget and spending data from cities to help us all get a sense of where the money is being spent. We're hoping that many more groups will join to open up the budget and spending of your city! 

Register for the [**Spending Data Party** ](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/forms/d/1uHNAh9cfP_F5nudGfhV8t0XnNPmFL7cXhkuqWHAMaR4/viewform)!

###Explore spending in your city - what to look for?<br>
<il>- Do you know how much your city actually spends on education compared to police enforcement?</il>

<il>- How can you get people involved in the budget of your city?<br> 
[OpenBudgetOakland](http://openbudgetoakland.org/mayor_13-15_proposed.html) created a site where citizens could comment on the budget proposal throughout the entire decision process. 

<il>- Which companies works for your city and do they actually do a good job?</il><br> 
Cities such as [London](http://openspending.org/gb-local-gla) and [Washington DC](http://openspending.org/dc-vendors-contractors) release transactional spending data that allows you to see what companies clean up the garbage and repair the roads. Let's make many more cities open up their spending data! 

### What can I do at tbe spending party?
<il>- **[Load and visualise](http://openspending.org/datasets/new)** the budget of your city or province and add it to the list of [90 cities already mapped](http://apps.openspending.org/maps/) across the world.</il>

<il>- **Open up budgets** from other local institutions such as [universities](http://openspending.org/blog/2013/06/17/universities-on-the-spending-map.html), public utilities or housing corporations.</il>

<il>- **Learn from online trainings** how to visualise budgets, how to analyse spending data or how you can set up [a local OpenSpending satellite site](https://github.com/openspending/satellite-template). We will run various trainings and are eager to hear if you can contribute. Sign up [to do a training here](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/forms/d/17diF5_alj37kvcY_2Oqx90xKz1aHJtjgVsXmL3yrHlY/viewform).</il> 

<il>- **Make OpenSpending better** by contributing to the code. We've got plans for some great enhancements and want to hear what you'd like to make.</il>

###FAQ:
<il>- I'm alone in my city, can I still join? </il><br> 
Yes! We'll will run online activities where you can work with community members in other cities. So don't hold your self back. Share your ideas on the mailing list as well. 

<il>-I don't know where to get budget or spending data from my city?<il><br>
Fear not! We'll make sure to share guides on how to access budget and spending data from your city and will also organise a **Data Clinic on July 10th**, where we'll help you search for data or ask your city for it, if it's not available.
