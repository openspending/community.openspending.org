In January I attended a conference in Morocco at the
[University of Mundiapolis in Casablanca](http://mundiapolis.ma/), to present OpenSpending. The
conference attracted a broad range of interests: civil society
organisations, journalists, private companies, academics and students,
the World Bank, and a senior representative of Morocco's Ministry of
Finance.

The [notes](http://mk.ucant.org/media/openspending-francais/) from my presentation.


The local press coverage from the conference reaffirmed the perception
that financial transparency is rising on the agenda in Morocco (in
French

and

1) What were the premisses for the meeting:

"The Moroccan government is currently examining a new proposal for
freedom of information law, and is considering to what extend
fianncial and budget transpanrency can be implemented. From
OpenSpending the message was that...

2) What role can OpenSpending, MySociety and other platforms play for transparency in Morocco and in the wider region?  

3) Challenges ahead:
- getting viable partners with technical capacities and ressources to take on financial transparency monitoring
- to develop local solutions and implementations, which can make a real impact (demands for localization, training)
- to push for strong transparency practises and laws in the country

It was the experience of MySociety that their parliamentary monitoring
tools were never accused of being partisan. It's important to keep
out of conventional politics: we're here to say "if you have transparency,
this is what you get" not "you should have transparency" or "you should spend
more money on this and less on that". The bulk of my presentation was on
four or five country studies, demonstrating the diversity of the places
which can use OpenSpending.

What maybe was not clear to the audience (and indeed, the press
coverage reflected this) was how OpenSpending and similar tools fit
into the landscape.  I was directly asked "is the Government of
Morocco going to use OpenSpending?", and very firmly responded that
this was a question for the Government (after all, a representative of
the government was sat only a few paces away).  The boundary between
government and private sector (both commercial and civil society) is
always evolving and sometimes contested, and it may be locate differently
in different societies. OpenSpending enables actors of all types (government,
private commercial, private non-profit and individuals) to participate
in discussions of spending, and by changing the costs can help enable
some actors to participate where previously this was infeasible.


When [Samuel Lee demonstrated his World Bank mobile app](http://openspending.org/blog/2013/01/29/worldbank-guest-post.html) in Arabic at
the conference, there was a marked uptick in audience attention;
ultimately OpenSpending is going to need an Arabic translation; it's
an official language in about twenty countries, many of which don't
use multiple languages Moroccan-style.


The Moroccans placed a particular emphasis on what they termed
"[vulgarisation](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgarisation)", by which
is meant the business of describing and explaining information intellgible
to experts such that the general public can understand it as well (the word
lacks the pejorative connotations it possesses in English). What this really
means is that in French the motivation of OpenSpending is expressible in
a *single word*.


what role is this tool playing? process



The details of any national budget are a always a matter of healthy
political controversy, and this is [especially true of
Morocco](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/18/us-morocco-protest-idUSBRE8AH0LX20121118). The Moroccan constitution contains an as yet unimplemented undertaking
to establish a Freedom of Information law; this would enable civil society
to obtain some information about expenditure. However, FOI laws tend not
to allow the requester to specify the format of the material published,
or that it be published as open data. Where governments publish fiscal
information AND comply with an FOI law, it can be a [somewhat confrontational
move](http://constitution-unit.com/2011/05/24/we-can-work-it-out-eric-pickles-vs-nottingham-city-council/) to use the FOI laws to compel publication of fiscal data

Transparency International Morocco had taken the OpenSpending software
and [got it working themselves](http://floussna.ma/), but did
encounter some problems; the OpenSpending community will work with them
to help resolve or mitigate these

Fundamentally, they're in the business of demonstrating what can usefully
be done with more detailed spending data; OpenSpending is a key tool
in a much larger process.

We're hoping to push for the localization of OpenSpending into
French. You can check our progress and help contribute at our site on
