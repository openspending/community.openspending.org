This is a post by [Martin Keegan](http://mk.ucant.org/).

Earlier this January I attended a conference in Morocco at the
University of Mundiapolis in Casablanca, to present OpenSpending; the
conference attracted a broad range of interests: civil society
organisations, journalists, private companies, academics and students,
the World Bank, and a senior representative of the Ministry of
Finance.

There was some press coverage from
[L'economiste](http://www.leconomiste.com/article/902383-la-transparence-budg-taire-fait-d-bat)
and [La Nouvelle
Tribune](http://www.lnt.ma/economie/la-transparence-budgetaire-au-centre-dune-rencontre-debat-63825.html)

The [notes](http://mk.ucant.org/media/openspending-francais/) from my presentation.

It was the experience of MySociety that their parliamentary monitoring
tools were never accused of being partisan. It's important to keep
out of conventional politics: we're here to say "if you have transparency,
this is what you get" not "you should have transparency" or "you should spend
more money on this and less on that". The bulk of my presentation was on
four or five country studies, demonstrating the diversity of the places
which can use OpenSpending.

What maybe was not clear to the audience (and indeed, the press
coverage reflected this) was how OpenSpending and similar tools fit
into the landscape.  I was directly asked "is the Government of
Morocco going to use OpenSpending?", and very firmly responded that
this was a question for the Government (after all, a representative of
the government was sat only a few paces away).  The boundary between
government and private sector (both commercial and civil society) is
always evolving and sometimes contested, and it may be locate differently
in different societies. OpenSpending enables actors of all types (government,
private commercial, private non-profit and individuals) to participate
in discussions of spending, and by changing the costs can help enable
some actors to participate where previously this was infeasible.



what role is this tool playing? process



The details of any national budget are a always a matter of healthy
political controversy, and this is [especially true of
Morocco](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/18/us-morocco-protest-idUSBRE8AH0LX20121118). 

The Moroccan constitution contains an as yet unimplemented undertaking
to establish a Freedom of Information law; this would enable civil society
to obtain some information about expenditure. However, FOI laws tend not
to allow the requester to specify the format of the material published,
or that it be published as open data. Where governments publish fiscal
information AND comply with an FOI law, it can be a [somewhat confrontational
move](http://constitution-unit.com/2011/05/24/we-can-work-it-out-eric-pickles-vs-nottingham-city-council/) to use the FOI laws to compel publication of fiscal data

Transparency International Morocco had taken the OpenSpending software
and [got it working themselves](http://floussna.ma/), but did encounter some problems. I was
able to speak at length to their staff to discuss the issues they were
having and what could done about them. What they wanted was:

0) French and Arabic language support; (Arabic is a right-to-left
language like Hebrew, so this is harder). When Samuel Lee demonstrated
his mobile app in Arabic, there was a marked uptick in audience attention.

1) the ability to link deeply into the visualisations from
department-specific discussion pages hosted in some external
pre-existing system (I think this is Facebook)

2) a good list of the best quality country-level datasets such that
fiscal transparency is not seen to be preponderantly a Western or
developed world phenomenon (we discuseed this; my presentation at the
conference concentrated on this)

3) some sort of case studies on the process of getting governments to open up
spending information; how this interacts if at all with the freedom of
information laws

4) some assistance with getting the WDMMG assembly kit working for them

Fundamentally, they're in the business of demonstrating what can usefully
be done with more detailed spending data; OpenSpending is a key tool
in a much larger process.
